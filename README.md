### Source Code

```
When I was first starting to switch over to PHP way back when, I was sticking with IIS (Windows Information Server) like glue. Because I was unaware of any other solutions at the time. In fact there are many software bundles what is known as LAMP which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl, or Python.
Compatibility
Since Apache can run on windows you can run most of these packages if not all on your home pc or laptop with little to no effort at all! Its an all in one web tool, which installs all the necessary tools and allows you to create PHP driven websites big and small without having to upload to a server to test. It is a must have for anyone building any type of website or if you are trying to learn web design. On Mac or Linux? Don't worry you are not left out of the loop, there is a LAMP package for you, you can check out XAMPP.
Which one is the right one?
There are many different types of these software packages available for FREE (Some of them are not free) and each include a different feature set than the next. So its up to you to choose which one works for your particular project. You can take a look at the Comparison chart of WAMP Software packages to find out some of the features each one has and which versions of Apache, php, MySql, and phpmyadmin use.
WampServer
For the last few years I have been using WampServer and it seems like a pretty good solution to me, its super easy to setup its FREE and allows you easy access to the power of PHP and Apache. It also has the ability to change the version of PHP or Apache you are using so you can easily match your online server settings. With Wamp you can even install WordPress locally on your system and you only have to modify a few files which WordPress tells you how to do this in the install process. I have tried XAMPP before but it seems a little bit more "laggy" in certain situations, like restarting your local server etc..
Setting up WampServer takes about 10 minutes depending on your internet connection
